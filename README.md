# SP-500-Market-Prediction
utilizes historical stock data (specifically, S&P 500 index data) to perform stock price prediction using a Random Forest Classifier.

Data Used: The code fetches historical S&P 500 index data, including Open, High, Low, Close prices, Volume, Dividends, and Stock Splits, and stores it in a DataFrame.

Prediction Target: The primary prediction target is whether the stock price will increase or decrease on the next trading day, represented as "Target" (1 for an increase, 0 for a decrease).

Technology Used:
Data Retrieval: The yfinance library is used to fetch S&P 500 data.
Data Processing: pandas is used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Machine Learning Model: A Random Forest Classifier is used for stock price prediction.
Metrics: sklearn's precision_score is used to evaluate model performance.
Predictive Features: The model uses various features such as Close price, Volume, Open, High, and Low prices as input features to predict the target variable.

involves data preprocessing, model training, and backtesting to assess the model's predictive performance. It uses rolling averages and trends over different time horizons to create additional predictive features.

The model's performance is evaluated using precision_score, and predictions are made on whether the stock price will increase or decrease.
